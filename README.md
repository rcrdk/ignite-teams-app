# ⚽️ React Native Ignite Teams App

This is a simple React Native app designed to help users organize soccer teams into groups and manage participants. Users can create groups, add and remove participants, and assign them to Team A or Team B. The app stores data persistently using **AsyncStorage**, utilizes **React Navigation** for navigation, and uses **Styled Components** for styling. This app was developed as a learning case during my lessons at [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).
